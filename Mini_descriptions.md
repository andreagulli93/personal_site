### work
A large part of my day is spent working where I combine the experience from consulting and data science skills to design,
code and deploy programmes that support the business automate processes or get extra information to make better decisions and prioritise effort.

### coding
In addition to spending parts of my working day coding, it is also one of my favourite passtimes.
I first started developing with an iOS app. More recently, most of my coding was part of my Data Science Master's course or smaller personal projects,
including this site.

You can find more on GitHub :)

### Gaming

### photography
Together with playing music, photography is a hobby that helps me relax. Alternating between my Canon EOS550d and iPhone 12 Pro,
I focus on outdoor photography with landscapes or historical sites. In the past, I did a lot of event photography in Australia and the UK.

For now, content can be found on [Facebook] or my personal [Instagram].

International relations and political economy are some of my favourite topics to read on.

### travel
Travel, whether near or far, is always an opportunity for an adventure. With my background and family we had a chance to explore different parts of Europe. It was only with university and later with the start of my career that I got opportunities to visit many parts of Asia and select parts of North America.
